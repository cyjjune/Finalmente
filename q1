Consider the following Java class.

public class Wizard{

  Spell[] spells;
  Potion[] potions;
  String name;
  int points=0;
  
  public Wizard(String name){
    this.name = name;}
    
}

A.  Write a method for the Wizard class named "powerUp" that adds 10 to the field "points".

   public int powerUp(){
    return this.points+10;
  }
  
B.  Write a method "cast" that casts the n-th element of the "spells" array. 

  public cast(){
    
  Include an interface (seperately) for the Spell class to insure your "cast" method will interact with the class.
  
    public Interface Interaction{
      public String cast(Spell[] n);}
  
C.  Write a "hello" method that prints an introduction stating the name of the Wizard.

public void Hello(){
  System.out.println("The Wizard's name is "+this.name);}
  
D.  Write a main method for the Wizard class. In it construct a wizard with name "Harry Poppins".  Use the hello() method.

public static void main(String[] arg){
  Wizard HP = new Wizard("Harry Poppins");
  Wizard DM = new Wizard("Draco Malfoy");
  DM.Hello(HP);}
